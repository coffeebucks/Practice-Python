"""Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message."""

### my solutions:

number = int(input("Can you guess my number?"))
if number % 4 == 0:
  print("Bingo! You have some superpower or something?")
elif number % 2 == 0:
  print("Not there yet but good direction. Now you know that number is an even.")
else:
  print("Oopsy! hmmm?")
